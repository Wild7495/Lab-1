       My name is Cooper  Wildman I am a 3rd year at CSUMB. I love to golf whenever I get the chance to. I also enjoy doing drone photogrphy.
        last year I coeded my very first website for a school project and I thought I did good for my very first time ever coding.
        I want to better my coding skills from taking this class.
